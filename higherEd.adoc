==== Grouper, midPoint and Event-Driven Architecture
===== midPoint, Internet2, InCommon, "InCommon Trusted Access Platform"

* Intro to Grouper--The AM in InC TAP
** Grouper expects a pre-existing source of subjects (the I in IAM)
* InCommon Trusted Access Platform
** Promoting Adoption
* TAP/midPoint Functional Overlap
** Our current direction:
*** mP handles Identity Management
*** Grouper as Auth. system for roles, orgs, entitlements, services
*** Grouper as Admin Point and Distributor of AM policy
*** midPoint receives AM information and policies from Grouper
*** mP as (de-)provisioning and synchronization engine

* Grouper/midPoint Integration Project--An I2/Evolveum collaboration
** Asynch approach for live sync (New development work)
*** AMQP protocol via RabbitMQ (0.9.1)
*** AMQP Topic naming conventions support the mapping from Grouper to mP data structures
** Full Reconciliation supported in more traditional ways

* Future of Async for provisioning/de-provisioning in TAP--A Research Question
** Attractions: Loose coupling: New subscribers come along, no direct impact or changes to mP as publisher
** Challenges of "eventual consistency"--Humans need a mental picture of how it works; concurrent systems are not easy to reason about
** Likely that HTTP APIs and Async Messaging will co-exist in hybrid environments
*** Important then to represent entities with the same schema in both, a shared data model
** How do we find the scope and limits of this approach?
