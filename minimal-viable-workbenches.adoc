*Two Minimal Viable Workbenches (MVWs)*
(essentially simplified versions of existing CSP workbench)
```
1) COm + subjSource + Grouper + Shib
or
2) mP  + subjSource + Grouper + Shib

Configuration option to include a set of pre-populated person entities, or not

That would already be enough to demonstrate IAM features up to provisioning access policies for Grouper users
```

*Logical first step beyond MVW*

```
Wire a System of Record to COm or mP
1) TAP-provided mock SIS and/or HR
or
2) Real SoR selected by campus, an SOR with which TAP has previously integrated
Allows for full-fledged lifecycle management and access policies
```

*Logical second step beyond MVW*

```
Set up (de-)provisioning to a campus system or service that TAP knows how to integrate
using COmanage, Grouper, and/or midPoint as provisioning engine
```
